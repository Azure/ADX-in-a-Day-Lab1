# Issues

For some reason I can not add issues to my project. To not loose them I write them down here:

- Free ADX Cluster Link does not open in new Window. Seems not to be possible with Git Hub. According to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3492153/markdown-open-a-new-window-link) you can use kramdown in Git Hub. 

- Challange 4: There is stated 3 capabilites but only two in bullet list.
